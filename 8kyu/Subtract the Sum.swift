Complete the function which get an input number n such that n >= 10 and n < 10000, then:

Sum all the digits of n.
Subtract the sum from n, and it is your new n.
If the new n is in the list below return the associated fruit, otherwise return back to task 1.

func subtractSum(_ n: Int) -> String {
    return "" // fruit name like "apple"
}
